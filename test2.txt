In this file I am learning how to create a new local file first.
Given that it is untracked, I will proceed to use the command "Git Add" to save the changes I have made to this file
Then I will use "Git Commit" to push this test2.txt file to staging area along with a message so "Git Commit -m"
Lastly to ensure that this file is shown in the repository aka Github web I will use the command "Git push Origin main"
